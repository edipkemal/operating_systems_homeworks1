Runtime of the Single Thread Program for the Given List:1.731000ms
Runtime of the Multi Thread Program for the Given List:0.117000ms
My opinion on the cause of difference in runtimes of parts:
We can clearly see that multi thread program much more faster than single thread program.
In single thread program, 5 operations executed with a single thread but in multi thread program, every operation executed with different threads.
So processor could do all operations in same time, that is why multi thread program is faster.
